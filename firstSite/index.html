	<h1>"I was never a Son of Horus. I was and remain a Luna Wolf. A proud son of Cthonia, a loyal servant of the Emperor, beloved by all. I am your enemy."</h1>
	<h2>â€” Garviel Loken's valediction to his former gene-father Horus Lupercal</h2>
	<p>Garviel Loken was originally the Captain of the Luna Wolves (later Sons of Horus) Space Marine Legion's 10th Company during the last days of the Great Crusade and up until the Istvaan III Atrocity that initiated the Horus Heresy.<br>

Loken was highly regarded as a warrior and commander by both his brethren and his Primarch. Admired for his cool head and intelligence as well as his record in battle, he was given the honour of induction into the Mournival, his Legion's cadre of close advisers to their Primarch Horus.<br>

	<h1 style="padding-left: 120px; text-align: left; font-size: 33px;">Istvaan III Atrocity:</h1>
	<p><img src="img/orbital.jpg"; align="left"; style="height: 311px; width: 138px; padding: 5px;">Horus chose the world of Istvaan III to dispose of those members of the four openly declared Traitor Legions -- the Sons of Horus, the Emperor's Children, the World Eaters and the Death Guard -- that he could not trust to follow him or serve the Chaos Gods in his new quest to dethrone the Emperor and rule the galaxy himself.<br>

Loken and Torgaddon, as well as approximately one-third of the 4 Legions' Astartes who were judged to be Loyalists, were sent to the capital city of the planet of Istvaan III under the pretext of putting down a rebellion against the Imperium of Man by the Slaaneshi-corrupted Planetary Governor Vardus Praal only to be slaughtered by Life Eater Virus Bombs launched from the Warmaster's orbiting fleet.</p>
